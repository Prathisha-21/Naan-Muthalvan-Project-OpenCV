Project Overview

1.  Crowd Counting and Density Estimation System

Description: Crowd Counting and Density Estimation systems use computer vision to estimate the number of people and their spatial distribution in a given area, enabling applications in surveillance, public safety, event management, and smart cities.

2. Underwater Object Detection for Marine Study 

Description: Underwater Object Detection systems help identify and monitor marine life, debris, geological formations, or human-made structures for oceanographic research, conservation, and exploration.

3. Real Time Traffic Sign Detection
   
Description: A real-time system that detects and recognizes traffic signals using computer vision. It helps improve traffic management and autonomous driving decisions.


Requirements:

1. Python 3.x

2. OpenCV (install opencv-python)

3. Numpy (pip install numpy)
